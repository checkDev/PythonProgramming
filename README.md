# PythonProgramming

My First step to Github.

I took Coursera course of 'A concise Introduction to Python' to learn the language.
This repo is for the weekly assignments in the learning path of the Project.

The Repo is broken in to several weeks , which teaches about different Python datastructures and its usage in Problem Solving.
